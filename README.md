## Project Overview

Fraud detection is crucial for financial systems to protect users and reduce losses due to fraudulent transactions. This project builds a machine learning model that classifies transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on various transaction characteristics. By leveraging historical data, the model aims to detect suspicious activities with high accuracy and low false-positive rates.

## Objectives

The main goals of this project are to:

1. Identify and classify fraudulent transactions from transaction data.
2. Reduce the rate of false positives to minimize interruptions for legitimate customers.
3. Provide a model that generalizes well to new, unseen data and can be implemented in a real-world fraud detection pipeline.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes transaction records with attributes such as:

- **Transaction Amount**: Amount of money involved in the transaction.
- **Transaction Date/Time**: Timestamp indicating when the transaction occurred.
- **Location**: Geographic data related to the transaction location.
- **Customer Information**: Data points related to the customer's history or demographics.
- **Other Features**: Additional attributes that may be helpful in distinguishing fraud from legitimate transactions.

The dataset is typically imbalanced, as fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones.

## Modeling Approach

The approach to building this fraud detection model includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Normalize or standardize transaction data for consistency.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **Time-Based Features**: Analyze transaction frequency or time gaps.
   - **Behavioral Features**: Explore patterns based on customer behavior, such as spending habits.
   - **Location-Based Features**: Evaluate risk based on transaction location differences.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - **Logistic Regression**: As a baseline model for fraud classification.
   - **Random Forest Classifier**: For capturing complex non-linear relationships.
   - **Gradient Boosting/ XGBoost**: To enhance performance on imbalanced datasets.
   - **Neural Networks**: For potential deep-learning-based feature extraction.

4. **Handling Class Imbalance**:
   - Techniques such as **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**, **undersampling**, or **class weights** are used to address the imbalance.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is critical in fraud detection. The following features are commonly engineered:

- **Transaction Frequency**: Count of transactions within a specific time window.
- **Transaction Location Change**: Flagging transactions that occur in unusual or far-off locations.
- **Customer Spending Patterns**: Differences from typical spending to detect anomalies.

## Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics focus on detecting fraud with high precision and recall:

- **Precision**: To minimize false positives, crucial for fraud detection.
- **Recall**: To capture as many fraudulent transactions as possible.
- **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall.
- **AUC-ROC Curve**: Measures the model’s ability to distinguish between classes.
- **Confusion Matrix**: For an in-depth look at model performance on fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions.
